The text introduces the concept of measurement units, distinguishing between fundamental (base) units and derived units, which together form a system of units. It outlines the historical use of CGS, FPS, and MKS systems, and explains that the International System of Units (SI) is now the globally accepted standard, developed by the BIPM and revised in 2018. The chapter also mentions upcoming sections on significant figures, dimensional analysis, and related exercises. The excerpt explains that the International System of Units (SI) uses seven base units—meter, kilogram, second, ampere, kelvin, mole, and candela—along with two additional derived units for angles: the radian for plane angles and the steradian for solid angles. Each base unit is defined by a fixed numerical value of a fundamental constant (e.g., the speed of light for the meter, the cesium transition frequency for the second). These definitions ensure that SI units are precise, universal, and based on immutable physical constants.
